  - ["config.mqttSubTopic", "s", "airfy/sub/device0", {title: "MQTT topic."}]

  # Overrides
  - ["wifi.ap.ssid", "s", "Airfy", {title: "Defualt SSID."}]
  - ["wifi.ap.pass", "s", "Apple999", {title: "Defualt Password."}]

#  - ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", get_cfg()->device.id);
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/sys_config.c or build/gen/sys_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
